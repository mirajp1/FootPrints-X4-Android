This is the official app of FootPrints X4, the technical fiesta of Faculty of Technology and Engineering-The Maharaja SayajiRao University of Baroda (MSU).

A technical extravaganza, FootPrints X3 attracted over 17000 participants from all over India to its hive. From technical bigwigs to non-technical electrifying events, engaging sessions to tantalizing lectures by famous personalities, innovative displays to the stock market chronicles, entertaining days and alluring game zones to rocking nights—FOOTPRINTS has it all! Marked by an emphasis on humanistic values and concerns, as a part of Footprints Social Responsibility, several activities such as educating the poor and also spreading computer education have been done at villages like Shahpura and Umarva. Moving ahead, with more than 17000 participants and more than 2.57 lac website hits in FootPrints X3, FootPrints has become a state-wide phenomenon and is tracing out an exponentially increasing career graph!

The enormous path FootPrints has travelled since its inception, vouches for the above maxim. Over the thirteen years since its genesis, in the year 2001 by Sir K Narayan Murthy, FootPrints has strived to nurture and enlighten the engineering brains of the country and has thereby earned the repute of the torch-bearer of all technical festivals of the west zone.

A brief plunge into the history takes us back to the year 2001 when a group of students compelled their brains to think beyond and took an initiative to bequeath others in the way alike and thus emerged a phenomenon named FootPrints. And since then, there’s no looking back..! 
Footprints returns in its 14th edition, bringing with it an experience of innovation, competition and learning. So, mark the days from 21st to 23rd Feb, 2014 on your calendars, as Footprints X4 is all set to keep you engrossed in its evergreen innovating spirit, pioneering ideas and ultimately urging you to think BEYOND!
